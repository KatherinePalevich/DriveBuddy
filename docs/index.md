DriveBuddy is the #1 app to keep track of practice drives for every student driver. From goals to an overall stats page, DriveBuddy will prepare you for the road test.

DriveBuddy takes the organization of a spreadsheet and turns it into a functional application. You can set personal goals or use the ones provided to record drives on the highway, neighborhood, and city street. After each practice drive, one is able to see the exact route they drove as well as the length of time elapsed during the drive and goals targeted. Now it is easy to complete the 50 hours recommended before taking the road test!
